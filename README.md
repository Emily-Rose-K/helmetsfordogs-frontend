## HELMETS FOR DOGS

Have a dog? Me too. She is reckless and runs into things a lot. That's why I've created helmetsfordogs! 
Check out the backend repo: [helmetsfordogs-api](https://github.com/Emily-Rose-K/helmetsfordogs-api)

### Features

MVP:
Sign in/Login/Logout functionality ✔️
Featured Gallery and Products on Home page ✔️
Gallery with posts of cute dogs ✔️
Shop where you can add items to your cart (it's there, it doesn't work exactly as planned)
Checkout page implemented with stripe  (it's there, it doesn't work exactly as planned)

### Tech used

The front end was built wiht React.js and react-bootstrap
Stripe was used for the payment services

### WireFrames

## Future Goals

I do want to actually create the functionality to add items to the cart, remove them from your cart, and save your cart when you log out and back in again.
I also want to get stripe working as it should.
Finally, I'd like to get the styling looking sharp.
